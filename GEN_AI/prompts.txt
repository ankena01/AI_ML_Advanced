customer_complaint = """
I am fuming with anger and regret over my purchase of the XUI890.
First, the price tag itself was exorbitant at 1500 $, making me expect exceptional quality.
Instead, it turned out to be a colossal disappointment.
The additional charges to fix its constant glitches and defects drained my wallet even more.
I spend 275 $ to get a new battery.
The final straw was when the phone's camera malfunctioned, and the repair cost was astronomical.
I demand a full refund and an apology for this abysmal product.
Returning it would be a relief, as this phone has become nothing but a money pit. Beware, fellow buyers!
